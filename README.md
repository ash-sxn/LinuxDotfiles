# fresh_ubuntu_setup
Script for setting up new linux system with things I use on my system with shellscript, only for debian based systems 
## Things I have in the script 
* Brave (chromium based browser)
* gh (github cli) 
* kitty  Terminal Emulator
* VsCode
* Copyq (Clipboard manager) (Keepboard is a better alternative in ubuntu App center)
* Ulauncher (Application Laucher for linux, like spotlight)
