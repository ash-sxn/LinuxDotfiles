Tealdeer (tldr)

A fast implementation of the tldr command line client in Rust. The tldr pages are a collection of simplified and community-driven man pages that focus on practical examples rather than exhaustive explanations.

Tealdeer provides simplified, example-based documentation for command line tools. Unlike traditional man pages, tldr pages show practical examples of how to use a command, making it much faster to understand basic usage.

Features:
- Fast and lightweight, written in Rust
- Colorful and readable output
- Automatic caching of documentation
- Offline access to documentation
- Customizable through a simple configuration file
