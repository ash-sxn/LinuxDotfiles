Alacritty - A cross-platform, GPU-accelerated terminal emulator

Alacritty is a modern terminal emulator that comes with sensible defaults and offers good performance. It takes advantage of GPU acceleration to provide a smooth and responsive terminal experience. Written in Rust, it's designed to be simple, fast, and feature-complete.

Key Features:
• GPU-accelerated rendering for improved performance
• Cross-platform (Linux, macOS, Windows, BSD)
• Simple, clean YAML configuration
• Vi mode for keyboard-based navigation
• Low latency with high refresh rate
• Customizable key bindings
• Support for scrollback, search, and selection
• Unicode support and font fallback
• URL detection and clicking
• Configurable text styles (bold, italic, underline)
• Ability to adjust window opacity
• Live configuration reload without restarting
• Custom color schemes
• Multiple terminal windows from a single process
• Support for 24-bit true color and wide-gamut color spaces

Alacritty focuses on simplicity and performance rather than having a large feature set. It doesn't include tabs or splits natively but works well with terminal multiplexers like tmux to provide these features.
