Git - Distributed version control system

Git is a free and open-source distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency. Git was created by Linus Torvalds in 2005 for development of the Linux kernel.

Key Features:
• Distributed development - Every developer has a full copy of the repository
• Branching and merging - Create multiple development lines and combine them
• Speed and efficiency - Fast operations even with large repositories
• Data integrity - Cryptographic authentication of history
• Staging area - Select exactly what changes go into each commit
• Small and fast - Minimal overhead and high performance
• Powerful workflow options - Support for various development models
• Extensive ecosystem - Hosts like GitHub, GitLab, BitBucket
• Large community and extensive documentation
• Cross-platform support (Linux, macOS, Windows)
• Free and open-source

Git has become the standard for version control in software development due to its flexibility, performance, and robust capabilities. It enables collaboration among developers and provides tools for tracking changes, reverting to previous states, and managing parallel development efforts.
